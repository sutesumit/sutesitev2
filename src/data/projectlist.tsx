My journey began in documentary photography, working with media, governments, and NGOs, before I moved into photo editing at a leading Indian news organization. Over time, my practice has evolved, deeply rooted in photography and the feminist principle that "the personal is political." This website, carefully built with web technologies, is an invitation to reflect, engage, and respond to my work.',
