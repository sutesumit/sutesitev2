## The Day Bun Staged a Coup

Sometimes, software doesn’t just fail—it conspires. This week, my Next.js dev server refused to run. The culprit? Bun, the shiny new JS runtime I had casually installed.

---

## Initial Failure

Running the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

resulted in:

```bash
Bun failed to remap this bin…
```
That began a long spiral of troubleshooting. I deleted node_modules, reinstalled them, removed Bun globally, tried running Node by its full path—nothing helped. Even npx had turned against me.

At this point, I wasn’t debugging. I was bargaining.

## The Plot Twist

Hours later, just when I was out of ideas and free LLM tokens were running low, I uncovered Bun’s secret hideout:

```bash
C:\Users\Sute\node_modules\.bin\node.bunx
C:\Users\Sute\node_modules\.bin\node.cmd
C:\Users\Sute\node_modules\.bin\node.exe
C:\Users\Sute\node_modules\.bin\node.ps1
C:\Users\Sute\bun.lock
```
There it was: Bun’s fingerprints on everything. These shims were quietly intercepting node and replacing it with themselves. My entire environment was being rerouted through Bun without my knowledge.

---

## The Cleanup

Turns out the fix was nothing fancy. Just wipe the hideout:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\node_modules"
Remove-Item -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\bun.lock"
```

Then I tried again:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally brought my server back to life. Imagine that.

## Moral of the Story

Bun tried to take over. I fought back. And I learned: curiosity is wonderful… but sometimes it comes with a hidden army in your home directory.
